"""All pacman.conf variants, generated in Python.

The variants:

  download_conf()          used by the package-cache step to fetch ISO packages on
                           ANY host (even Manjaro): hard-coded Arch mirrors, no host
                           mirrorlist, SigLevel=Never, no alpm DownloadUser.

  build_profile_conf()     the archiso profile's pacman.conf that mkarchiso's
                           internal pacstrap uses. Standard Arch base, PLUS:
                             - NoExtract usr/lib/os-release (Az'arch branding wins)
                             - an injected CacheDir (the persistent build cache)
                             - optionally rewritten to a file:// local repo for
                               fully-offline rebuilds.

  installer_base_conf()    the pacman.conf shipped to the INSTALLED system
                           (/etc/pacman.conf): plain Arch defaults, multilib on.

  installer_pacstrap_conf()the transient pacman.conf the on-disk installer swaps in
                           during pacstrap: adds the file:// [pacstrap-azarch-repo]
                           so installation works fully offline from the ISO's repo.
