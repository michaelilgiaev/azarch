"""Calamares installer configuration, authored as config-as-Python strings.

Az'arch boots to a minimal Openbox live session and auto-launches Calamares
(Manjaro-style) to install Az'arch Linux to disk. Calamares 3.4.2 reads:

  /etc/calamares/settings.conf          -- module search paths + the sequence
  /etc/calamares/modules/<name>.conf    -- one config per module in the sequence
  /etc/calamares/branding/azarch/*      -- product branding + slideshow

Every builder below returns the exact text of one of those files. The install is
OFFLINE by design: the target root is unpacked from the live SquashFS by the
`unpackfs` module (NOT pacstrapped over the network), matching how the rest of
Az'arch installs. Btrfs is the DEFAULT filesystem and full-disk LUKS encryption
is offered as a toggle in the partition page.

Style note: Calamares config files are YAML (settings.conf, branding.desc, and
every modules/*.conf). They are emitted verbatim as the strings below. The
`emit_map()` at the bottom returns {relative path under /etc/calamares -> content}
so steps.py can iterate and write the whole tree with emit.write_text.

Calamares 3.4.x config-key notes (all VERIFIED against the shipped
extra/calamares 3.4.2 module schemas -- these were bugs caught in review):
  - partition.conf: `defaultFileSystemType` (NOT defaultFileSystem) sets the
    default fs. LUKS is offered when `luksGeneration: luks2` is present with an
    encryption-capable install choice; the "Encrypt system" checkbox appears
    automatically. No `enableLuksAutomatedPartitioning` key is needed.
  - unpackfs.conf: sourcefs must be "squashfs" (with the airootfs.sfs path), not
    "filesystem" (which is not a recognized type). See ARCHISO_SFS.
  - The module is named `services` (dir modules/services/); `services-systemd` is
    only the schema filename. Its schema allows ONLY a `units:` array.
  - fstab.conf allows ONLY `crypttabOptions` + `tmpOptions` (tmpOptions required);
    real mount options come from the partition module / mount.conf.
  - grubcfg.conf `defaults:` requires GRUB_TIMEOUT + GRUB_DEFAULT; kernel args go
    in the top-level `kernel_params:` (defaults' GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT is
    overwritten by the module). `keep_distributor` is snake_case.
  - bootloader.conf is additionalProperties:false: kernel:/img:/fallback: are NOT
    valid keys (derived from the target automatically).
  - initcpiocfg + initcpio MUST be in the exec sequence or a LUKS/btrfs root is
    unbootable (the copied-from-live initramfs lacks the encrypt hook).
  - branding.desc style keys are Capitalized (SidebarBackground, ...).
  - The `sequence` lists ONLY modules configured below or needing none.
