"""Build Az'arch's OWN packages (calamares, librewolf) with makepkg and drop the
resulting *.pkg.tar.zst into the offline repo the rest of the build already uses.

Everything not in the official Arch repos is built from recipes WE author in
azarch.config.pkgbuild -- never the AUR, never an AUR helper. This module is the
runner: it emits those recipes into a scratch dir, ensures the host has the
makedepends, runs `makepkg` as an UNPRIVILEGED user (makepkg refuses root), and
copies the built packages into cache/pkgs/repo/ so the normal index-reconcile
step (packages._reconcile_index) folds them into pacstrap-azarch-repo.db next to
the Arch packages. `calamares`/`librewolf` in packages.x86_64 then resolve from
the local repo like anything else.

Tiers: full_compile=False builds librewolf by repackaging the verified upstream
tarball (fast); full_compile=True compiles it from Firefox source (hours). The
flag is chosen by config.pkgbuild.recipe_dirs().

Offline policy: makepkg needs to FETCH sources (the calamares/firefox/librewolf
tarballs + git). When the build is fully offline (BUILD_OFFLINE) we SKIP the
makepkg stage if the packages are already present in the repo, and fail loudly
if they are not -- exactly like the rest of the cache-first design.
