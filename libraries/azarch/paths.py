"""Filesystem layout for the build.

Mirrors the directory scheme the old compile.sh used, so the Docker bind mounts
(cache/ output/ logs/) and the on-disk artifacts land in exactly the same places:

  REPODIR/                 repo root (where compile.sh lives)
    libraries/data/        verbatim data files (packages.x86_64, big QML)
    cache/                 persistent download cache (git-ignored, survives builds)
      build/               WORKDIR on a NATIVE run: disposable mkarchiso scratch
      pkgs/                persistent package repo + synced DBs (the offline store)
      pacman-pkg/          pacstrap CacheDir injected into the profile pacman.conf
    output/                BUILDDIR: the finished .iso lands here
    logs/                  full.log + steps.log

In DOCKER the disposable WORKDIR is moved OUT of the bind-mounted cache/ to a
container-internal path (/tmp/azarch-build) so its root-owned mkarchiso scratch
dies with the container and can never leave root-owned files locked on the host
(a hard `docker kill` sends an untrappable SIGKILL that skips the handback). The
persistent stores (cache/pkgs, cache/pacman-pkg) and the ISO (output/) stay on
the bind mounts and are chowned back to the host user. See WORKDIR below.
