This is a year-old, neglected, poorly put-together project that is undergoing a massive overhaul. Nothing works correctly yet, so please come back later.

## 💽 Install

1. **Download the ISO (or [compile the ISO yourself](#-compile))**  
   The ISO is hosted on Google Drive (GitHub does not allow files larger than 2 GB).
   
   **📥Link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/18nclTLo05_KU7uOfYd_WTnI0LK--mGE6/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18nclTLo05_KU7uOfYd_WTnI0LK--mGE6/view?usp=sharing)**

2. **Create a Bootable USB**  
   Use one of the following tools to write the ISO to a USB drive:
   - **[balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)** (Windows/macOS/Linux)
   - **[Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)** (Windows only)
   - `dd` command (Linux/macOS):
     ```bash
     sudo dd if=azarch-2025.07.28-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress && sync
     ```
     ⚠️ Replace `/dev/sdX` with your actual USB device (this will erase the disk).

3. **Boot from USB**  
   Reboot your machine and use your BIOS/UEFI boot menu to boot from the USB drive.

4. **Live Session and Installation**

   Some considerations when using the live session:
   - Reserves 4 GB of RAM.
   - Runs entirely from RAM, nothing gets saved after reboot.
   - Uses a generic open-source graphics driver.

   The ISO boots into a live session and automatically launches the Az'arch
   installer, which is powered by Calamares.

   From the live session you can:
   - Install Az'arch.
   - Perform machine rescue tasks.
   - Do general work.

## 🧰 Compile

You can clone this repository and compile the ISO yourself. The first build needs an internet connection to download every component that goes into the ISO, after that everything is cached and rebuilds run fully offline. Build with Docker. The ISO is assembled with `mkarchiso`, which resolves the ISO's package list against the build host's Arch Linux repositories. That means the build only works on a genuine Arch userland with the real Arch `core`, `extra`, and `multilib` repositories. On anything else those repositories are wrong or missing and the build fails with errors like `target not found: archinstall` or endless kernel-provider prompts. Docker sidesteps all of that, the image is `archlinux:latest`, so the build runs inside real Arch no matter what machine you are on.

The build runs in Docker, so the steps are the same on every operating system.

1. **Install Docker and Git.**

   <details>
   <summary><b>🐧 Linux</b></summary>

   - Install both with your package manager:
     - Arch-based: `sudo pacman -S --needed docker git`
     - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker.io git`
     - Fedora: `sudo dnf install docker git`
   - Start Docker: `sudo systemctl enable --now docker`

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary><b>🍎 macOS</b></summary>

   - Install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and launch it (wait until the whale icon says Docker is running).
   - Git ships with the Xcode command line tools: `xcode-select --install`

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary><b>🪟 Windows</b></summary>

   - In an Administrator PowerShell, install WSL2: `wsl --install` (you may be prompted to reboot).
   - Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and enable **"Use the WSL 2 based engine"** in its settings.
   - Open your WSL distro (e.g. Ubuntu) and install Git: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git`

   </details>

2. **Clone the repository and enter it**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/michaelilgiaev/azarch.git
   cd azarch
   ```

3. **Build the Docker image** (creates the Arch build environment)
   ```
   sudo docker build -t azarch .
   ```

4. **Compile the ISO.** Pick one of the two commands below. The ISO is written to
   `output/`, downloaded packages are cached in `cache/`, and logs go to `logs/`.

   **Default** (recommended):
   ```
   sudo docker run --rm -it --init --privileged \
     -e HOST_UID="$(id -u)" -e HOST_GID="$(id -g)" \
     -v "$PWD/cache:/build/cache" \
     -v "$PWD/output:/build/output" \
     -v "$PWD/logs:/build/logs" \
     azarch
   ```

   **Full compile** — builds everything from source, takes hours:

   Estimate how long a full compile will take on your machine:

   ```
   sudo docker run --rm -it azarch --estimate-full-compile
   ```

   </td></tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>

   ```
   sudo docker run --rm -it --init --privileged \
     -e HOST_UID="$(id -u)" -e HOST_GID="$(id -g)" \
     -v "$PWD/cache:/build/cache" \
     -v "$PWD/output:/build/output" \
     -v "$PWD/logs:/build/logs" \
     azarch --full-compile
   ```

5. **Get the ISO.** It's in the `output/` folder. On **Windows (WSL)** that folder
   opens in File Explorer at `\\wsl$\<distro>\home\<your-username>\azarch\output`.

- **Wipe the cache** to force a fresh, fully-online rebuild:

  <thead>
  <tr><th align="left">ℹ️ NOTE</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

  If the compile was stopped mid-process, the ownership handback may not have run,
  so some files in `cache/` can be left root-owned and `git clean` won't remove
  them. In that case wipe it with:

  ```
  sudo rm -rf cache/
  ```

  </td></tr>

  ```
  git clean -Xdf        # deletes cache/, output/, logs/ (all git-ignored)
  ```
