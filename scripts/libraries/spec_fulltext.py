"""
spec_fulltext -- render the COMPLETE component listing as a formatted plain-text
file (documentation/SPECIFICATIONS_COMPONENTS_FULL.txt).

Where the SVG is the readable at-a-glance shape of the distribution (a curated
subset per layer) and SPECIFICATIONS_GENERAL.md is the prose/subsystem view, this
file is the exhaustive one: EVERY package in the transitive closure, nothing
collapsed, each with its real metadata and a human-language description of what it
is and does.

The human description is NOT hand-written and NOT from an LLM: it is the official
Arch package description (the `%DESC%` field of the package's record in the
core/extra/multilib databases -- the exact one-liner shown on archlinux.org and by
`pacman -Si`), plus the upstream project URL. That means it is real, offline,
deterministic, and can never drift from the package set.

The layout is designed to be pleasant to read directly AND trivially machine-
parseable: each component is a block introduced by a `### name` header and a set
of `key: value` lines with stable keys, so the file can be grep'd or parsed back
into structured records without a second data source. The interactive twin of
this listing is the browsable HTML map (spec_html).
