# This produces two artifacts:
#   documentation/SPECIFICATIONS_GENERAL.md  the general / developer view:
#                                     at-a-glance facts, what Az'arch changes on
#                                     top of Arch, and the subsystem breakdown.
#                                     No dependency-graph tables (those are below).
#   documentation/SPECIFICATIONS_COMPONENTS.svg  a navigable layered image of the
#                                     dependency graph, kernel at the bottom up to
#                                     leaf apps at the top, boxes coloured by
#                                     category and marked by edition.
# Both are computed from the real package set, with real versions.
#
# The dependency data is resolved from the official Arch Linux core/extra/multilib
# package databases (the repos the ISO is actually built against), NOT from the
# host's pacman databases -- on a non-Arch host those carry different packages and
# versions and would produce a wrong spec. The databases are fetched once and
# cached under cache/spec-db/; pass --offline to reuse them without network.
#
# This is a thin shim: it locates the repo, checks for python3, and hands off to
# scripts/libraries/pull_specifications.py, which orchestrates the work across
# scripts/libraries/spec_{db,resolve,classify,content,render,svg}.py. All flags
# are passed straight through.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/pull_specifications.sh [options]
#
# Options (forwarded to the Python orchestrator):
#   -o, --output FILE   write the general Markdown here (default: documentation/SPECIFICATIONS_GENERAL.md)
#       --svg FILE      write the components graph SVG here (default: documentation/SPECIFICATIONS_COMPONENTS.svg)
#   -m, --manifest FILE package manifest (default: libraries/data/packages.x86_64)
#       --db-cache DIR  where to cache the Arch .db files (default: cache/spec-db)
#       --mirror URL    Arch mirror base URL to fetch databases from
#       --offline       reuse cached .db files; do not download
#       --stdout        print the Markdown to stdout (skips writing both files)
#   -h, --help          show this help and exit
