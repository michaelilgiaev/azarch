# azarch - ISO build environment
#
# This image gives compile.sh a clean, genuine Arch Linux userland with the
# real Arch core/extra/multilib repositories. That is the whole point: the ISO
# is built with mkarchiso, which resolves the ISO's package list against the
# HOST's pacman repos. On a non-Arch host (Manjaro, Ubuntu+WSL, macOS, etc.)
# those repos are wrong or absent, so the build must happen inside Arch. This
# container provides that regardless of the machine you run it on.
#
# Build:  docker build -t azarch .
# Run:    docker run --rm -it --privileged \
#           -v "$PWD/cache:/build/cache" \
#           -v "$PWD/output:/build/output" \
#           -v "$PWD/logs:/build/logs" \
#           azarch
#         These three mounts mirror compile.sh's own directory scheme so the
#         host keeps the persistent download cache (cache/, which also holds the
#         disposable profile+scratch tree in cache/build/), the build output
#         incl. the finished ISO written directly to output/, and both build logs
#         (logs/). No stray host-side out/ dir is created.
#         (--privileged is required: mkarchiso mounts proc/sys/dev and uses
#          loop devices + squashfs inside the airootfs.)

# Refresh the keyring and sync the toolchain the build needs on the build host:
#   archiso       -> mkarchiso
#   base-devel    -> makepkg and friends
#   go            -> building Go-based ISO components
#   git, sudo     -> checkout tooling; the build shells out through sudo internally
#   python        -> the build itself: compile.sh is a thin PTY/sudo shim that
#                    hands off to `python3 -m azarch.build` (see libraries/)
# --noconfirm keeps the build non-interactive.

# pacman.conf) makes pacman reject every signed package: explicitly-requested
# targets then surface as the misleading "error: target not found: <pkg>", and
# pacstrap dies with "There is no secret key available to sign with." mkarchiso
# runs pacstrap internally, so the keyring must be live in this image.

# Project lives here. compile.sh writes everything under three dirs at the build
# root: cache/ (persistent downloads, plus the disposable profile+scratch tree in

# to the host to persist them:
#   -v "$PWD/cache:/build/cache" -v "$PWD/output:/build/output" -v "$PWD/logs:/build/logs"
# compile.sh re-execs itself on a PTY (via util-linux `script`), then hands off
# to the Python build driver which draws a pinned progress bar. The bar and the
# `script` re-exec want a sane terminal type; a bare container has none, so give
# it xterm (its terminfo ships with the base ncurses package).

# mounts cache/ output/ logs/ would otherwise be root-owned on the host and thus
# "locked" for the invoking user. compile.sh chowns those trees back to the host
# user on every exit path -- but the host uid/gid CANNOT be detected inside the
# container (COPY and the auto-created bind mounts are all root-owned), so they
# MUST be passed at run time:
#   docker run -e HOST_UID="$(id -u)" -e HOST_GID="$(id -g)" ...
# Left empty here on purpose: an empty value is treated as "unset" (compile.sh
# then warns and skips), whereas a default of 0 would silently chown to root and
# leave everything locked. Do NOT default these to a number.

#
# IMPORTANT: run this image with `docker run --init` (the README run commands
# already pass it). compile.sh re-execs via `exec script ...`, so without --init
# the container's PID 1 is that `script` process; the kernel drops unhandled
# signals to PID 1 and never reaps orphans, so Ctrl-C leaves the build hanging.
# `--init` inserts tini as PID 1 to forward signals and reap orphans; the Python
# build driver's SIGINT/SIGTERM handler additionally kills the whole process group
# so pacman/mkarchiso die immediately. tini is TTY-transparent, so PTY logging works.
